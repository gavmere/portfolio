            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>Hi, I'm Gavin and I am passionate about solving data problems. This includes topics such as data engineering, analytics, and machine learning. I have previously interned at Cadence Design Systems and S&P Global as a Data Engineer. Equipped with a plethora of data tooling, I am confident I could effectively solve any problems that come to me. I currently attend UC San Diego's Data Science program, graduating March 2026. I am currently seeking one more internship experience for the summer of 2025 (perferably with cool company merch)!</p>
